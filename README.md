# Code Snippets
<!-- put snippets of code inside ``` ``` so it will look like code -->
<!-- if you want to put blockquotes use a > -->

Below is an example of the HTML5 sectioning utilized to create a section with a specific internal article and its constituents. 

```
    <section class="section">

            <heading>
                <p>
                    section
                </p>
            </heading>

            <section id="article">
                <heading>
                    <p>
                        article
                    </p>
                </heading>
                <h1>
                    h1, h2, h3
                </h1>
                <p>
                    p
                </p>
            </section>

        </section>

```


# Learning points
<!-- Learning points where you would write what you thought was helpful -->
* margin auto is a useful tool to fix the main content in the center of a page
* precedence is an important factor for CSS: styles defined later supersede the ones defined before
* if the HTML defines a piece of text within a section and then as a &lt;p&gt;, then the CSS stylings for &lt;p&gt; will take precedence if they are defined after the section
* floats provide a simple way to change the default flow that HTML webpages display
